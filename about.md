I found myself passing abandoned buildings wondering what lay behind the boarded windows and fencing. Surely there was more to these places than a battered exterior and a few faded signs. I started squeezing past the perimeter to see what lay inside. I was astounded at what I saw - massive machines sitting in silence, tools left as they were - moments frozen yet subjected to the passage of time. These worlds, isolated in both space and time and located right in the midst of our society, never fail to captivate me.

My interest in photographing these locations grew out of a desire to document what I saw. Seeing the beauty present in these buildings, I realised that a simple snapshot would not do them justice. I would note down names and locations in order to return, intending to capture the hidden beauty of these moments in time, forgotten by a world that is all too willing to ignore and destroy them. With my camera I aim to enlighten outsiders to the majesty of these urban structures that I visit. I want to remind people of the shortness of existence.
